            <p>Hi! My name is Arnav Mohakud. I am a senior doing a Computer Science major, and minors in Data Science
                and
                Mathematics. I am interested in learning about the social background behind the tech scene, and its
                history
                and development. I want understand the biasses that both I as well as other people hold, and how we can
                improve awareness and equity in technology and information work.</p>

            <h2>Siddhanth Pandey</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer science student interested in both building technology and understanding its social
                impact. In LIS 500: Code and Power, I'm exploring how societal factors like bias, labor, and access
                shape computing, and how computing, in turn, affects society. I'm excited to examine the human side of
                technology alongside the technical.
