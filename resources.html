      <!-- Intro -->
      <p>
        Implicit bias is about patterns in our thinking that can influence decisions even when we believe we are being fair.
        This page collects simple explanations and starter resources for first year college students who are seeing these ideas for the first time.

      <h2>What implicit bias means</h2>
      <!-- Explanation -->
      <p>
        Implicit bias describes associations we learn from our surroundings, like media, schools, and social norms.
        These associations can affect how we interpret people, trust information, and react in fast situations, even if we do not intend to judge anyone.
      </p>

      <!-- Campus examples -->
      <p>
        In a college setting, this can show up in small moments like who gets interrupted, whose ideas are credited, who is assumed to be prepared,
        and who is asked to explain themselves. Small patterns can add up over time.

      <h2>Implicit Bias Tests and what they can and cannot do</h2>
      <!-- Explanation -->
      <p>
        Implicit bias tests are usually timed tasks that look at how quickly you connect words and images.
        They can be useful as a reflection tool, but they are not a full measure of your character and they do not predict every real world decision.
      </p>

      <!-- Reflection tips -->
      <p>
        A helpful approach is to treat results as a conversation starter. Ask what experiences shaped the association, where you might see it show up,
        and what habits could reduce its influence in daily choices.

      <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
      <!-- Explanation -->
      <p>
        Intersectionality is a way to describe how parts of identity combine, like race, gender, class, disability, and sexuality.
        People can face overlapping barriers that are not explained well by looking at only one identity at a time.
      </p>

      <!-- Practical example -->
      <p>
        For example, two students might both face bias, but the type and impact can differ depending on how their identities combine.
        Thinking this way helps us avoid one size fits all solutions.
