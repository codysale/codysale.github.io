        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This page is designed for students who are beginning to learn about implicit bias and related ideas.
            The goal is to provide clear explanations and helpful starting points so that new learners can better understand
            how social experiences influence perception, decision making, and everyday interactions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What is implicit bias -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>What is implicit bias</h2>
        <p>
            Implicit bias refers to automatic mental associations that influence how we think about different groups of people.
            These patterns develop over time through media exposure, cultural messages, education, and personal experiences.
            Because they operate quickly and often outside of awareness, they can shape behavior even when someone believes they are being fair.
        </p>

        <p>
            In academic and professional environments, implicit bias may affect expectations, communication, evaluation, and opportunity.
            Recognizing that these patterns exist is the first step toward reducing their impact.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why it matters -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Why awareness matters</h2>
        <p>
            Many people value fairness and equality, yet unconscious assumptions can still influence everyday decisions.
            Small differences in attention, tone, or opportunity can accumulate over time and contribute to unequal outcomes.
            Building awareness helps individuals pause, reflect, and make more intentional choices.
        </p>

        <p>
            Awareness is not about blame. It is about understanding how human thinking works and learning strategies that support more equitable environments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Implicit Bias Test -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Implicit Association Tests</h2>
        <p>
            Implicit Association Tests measure how quickly people connect certain ideas or categories.
            The results can reveal patterns that may not be obvious through self reflection alone.
            These tools are best used as a starting point for learning rather than as a final judgment about a person.
        </p>

        <p>
            After taking a test, it can be helpful to reflect on where associations may have come from and how awareness could influence future decisions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Intersectionality -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
        <p>
            Intersectionality explains how different aspects of identity combine to shape a person’s experiences.
            Factors such as race, gender, class, disability, and sexuality do not operate separately.
            Instead, they interact and create unique advantages or barriers depending on the situation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding intersectionality helps avoid oversimplified assumptions and encourages more thoughtful approaches to inclusion and policy.
        </p>

    <!-- Learning strategies -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Ways to apply this knowledge</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Slow down important decisions and focus on evidence</li>
            <li>Seek perspectives from people with different experiences</li>
            <li>Question assumptions about ability, behavior, or intent</li>
            <li>Support systems and policies that promote equal access</li>
