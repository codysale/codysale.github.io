    <h2>Resources for Implicit Bias</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to this resource page on implicit bias (IB). This guide is designed for students who are just
      starting to explore how our experiences and social context can influence how we perceive and interact with others.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Implicit Bias?</h3>
    <p>
      Implicit bias (sometimes called implicit prejudice) refers to attitudes or stereotypes that can influence our
      understanding, actions, and decisions—often without us realizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why it matters: Even when we consciously value fairness, implicit biases can still shape everyday choices
      in school, work, and online spaces.

    <h3>The Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h3>
    <p>
      The IAT is a tool that can help you reflect on automatic associations. It’s not a “grade”—it’s a starting point
      for awareness and learning.

    <h3>Intersectionality</h3>
    <p>
      Intersectionality (a term associated with Kimberlé Crenshaw) describes how identities like race, gender, class,
      and sexuality overlap and can create different experiences of advantage or discrimination.
