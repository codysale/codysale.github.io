    <h2>Implicit Bias Resources (Library-Style Guide)</h2>

    <p>
      If you’ve ever judged something “instantly” (a person, a resume, a comment in class), you’ve seen how fast the brain works.
      This guide breaks down a few key ideas—<strong>implicit bias</strong>, <strong>intersectionality</strong>, and the idea behind
      an <strong>implicit bias test (IBT)</strong>—and points you to beginner-friendly sources.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Quick Definition: What “Implicit” Means Here</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Implicit bias</strong> refers to automatic mental shortcuts that can influence perception and behavior without you
        consciously choosing them. It’s not the same thing as openly endorsing prejudice—someone can value fairness and still be
        pulled by learned associations.
      </p>
      <p>
        These associations can come from repeated exposure to stereotypes (news, social media, movies), patterns in your environment,
        and everyday experiences that train your expectations over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Where It Shows Up (College + Tech Examples)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Classrooms:</strong> who gets called on, who gets interrupted, who is assumed to be “prepared.”</li>
        <li><strong>Group projects:</strong> who becomes the “leader,” who gets stuck doing the “support work.”</li>
        <li><strong>Hiring/internships:</strong> snap judgments about names, accents, schools, or “culture fit.”</li>
        <li><strong>Tech systems:</strong> data and design choices can reproduce bias at scale (search, ranking, ads, facial analysis).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A well-known example of bias in algorithms:

      <h3>IBT / IAT: What These Tests Are Actually Trying to Measure</h3>
      <p>
        An “IBT” (often related to the <strong>Implicit Association Test</strong> idea) usually uses speed-based sorting tasks.
        The logic is: if two concepts are strongly linked in your mind, you might respond faster when they’re paired together.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, these tests are best treated as a <strong>reflection tool</strong>, not a final verdict on someone’s character.
        Results can shift with mood, familiarity, context, and practice effects—so the most useful outcome is asking,
        “What associations might my environment have trained into me?”
      </p>

        Plain explanation of how implicit measures work:

      <h3>Intersectionality (Why “One Label” Explanations Miss Real Life)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Intersectionality</strong> is a framework for understanding how multiple identities and social positions overlap.
        Instead of viewing experiences through a single category (only race, only gender, only class), intersectionality focuses on
        how these factors combine and shape outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: two people can both face sexism, but the form it takes can differ depending on race, disability, immigration status,
        or class. Intersectionality helps explain why the same policy can affect people differently.
      </p>

      <h3>Practical Moves: Reducing Bias Without Pretending You’re Perfect</h3>
      <p>
        Bias reduction is less about “being a good person once” and more about building habits and systems that prevent snap
        assumptions from driving decisions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow decisions down:</strong> bias spikes when rushed or stressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Use structure:</strong> rubrics for grading/hiring reduce “vibes-based” judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Counter-stereotype exposure:</strong> seek examples that break narrow assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Check patterns:</strong> track outcomes (who gets feedback, who gets opportunities).</li>
      </ul>
