  <h2>Resources for Implicit Bias</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to this resource page on implicit bias (IB). This guide is designed for students who are just beginning
    to explore how our experiences, social environments, and cultural messages shape the way we think about and
    interact with others. Here you will find definitions, key concepts such as intersectionality and the Implicit
    Association Test (IAT), and links to beginner-friendly resources.
  </p>

  <h3>What is Implicit Bias?</h3>
  <p>
    Implicit bias refers to attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions without
    our conscious awareness. These biases develop over time through exposure to media, social environments, and
    cultural norms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because implicit bias operates automatically, it can influence behavior even when a person consciously believes
    in fairness and equality. For example, bias can affect classroom participation, hiring decisions, healthcare
    treatment, or how people are perceived in everyday interactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implicit bias is part of a broader concept called implicit social cognition, which explains how perceptions and
    associations can operate prior to conscious intention or control.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Understanding implicit bias is important because technology, algorithms, and data
    systems can reflect the same hidden assumptions that exist in society. Recognizing these patterns is the first step
    toward creating more equitable systems.

  <h3>The Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h3>
  <p>
    The Implicit Association Test is a research-based tool that helps individuals explore unconscious associations
    related to race, gender, age, and other social categories. The test measures reaction times to identify patterns
    in automatic thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    The IAT is not meant to label someone as biased or unbiased. Instead, it is a starting point for self-reflection
    and awareness. Many students find it surprising to see how quickly their minds make certain associations.

  <h3>Intersectionality</h3>
  <p>
    Intersectionality is a concept introduced by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw. It explains how different aspects
    of identity—such as race, gender, class, sexuality, and ability—overlap and interact to shape people’s experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than looking at discrimination through a single lens, intersectionality recognizes that individuals may
    experience multiple forms of disadvantage or privilege at the same time. For example, a person’s experience in a
    workplace or online space may be shaped by the combination of their gender, race, and socioeconomic background.
  </p>

  <p>
    Understanding intersectionality is especially important in technology and information systems, where design
    decisions can unintentionally exclude or disadvantage certain groups.

  <h3>Why This Matters for LIS 500</h3>
  <p>
    In LIS 500, we examine how power and inequality shape information systems, data, and digital platforms.
    Learning about implicit bias and intersectionality helps us better understand how technology can either
    reinforce social inequalities or help reduce them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember: Implicit bias is part of being human. Learning about it is not about blame—it is about awareness,
    reflection, and growth.
