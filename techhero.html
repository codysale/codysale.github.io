  <h2>Tech Hero</h2>

  <h3>Timnit Gebru</h3>

  <p>
    Timnit Gebru is a computer scientist and leading voice in ethical artificial intelligence. Her work focuses on
    algorithmic bias, the social risks of large-scale AI systems, and the need for accountability in the technology
    industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gebru became widely known for her research showing that facial recognition systems had significantly higher error
    rates for women and people with darker skin tones. This work highlighted how biased training data and design
    decisions can reinforce existing social inequalities.
  </p>

  <p>
    After working as a researcher at Google, she co-founded the <strong>Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR)</strong>,
    an independent organization that studies the real-world impacts of artificial intelligence. DAIR focuses on
    community-centered research and promotes transparency, fairness, and ethical responsibility in AI development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gebru challenges norms in the tech industry by speaking openly about power, labor practices, and the environmental
    and social costs of large technology systems. Her work emphasizes that technology is never neutral—it reflects the
    values and priorities of the people and organizations that build it.
  </p>

  <p>
    By advocating for inclusive research practices and stronger oversight, she has helped shift conversations about AI
    toward equity, accountability, and the protection of vulnerable communities.
