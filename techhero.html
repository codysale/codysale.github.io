    <h3>Joy Buolamwini</h3>

    <p>
      Joy Buolamwini is a researcher and artist who has pushed the tech industry to confront bias in facial recognition and artificial intelligence. While studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she noticed that some facial analysis systems struggled to recognize darker skin tones. That experience helped shape her focus on fairness, accountability, and transparency in technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buolamwini founded the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that raises awareness about the social impact of AI and advocates for better standards in how AI systems are built and tested. Her work connects technical issues like training data and model evaluation to real world harms such as discrimination in hiring, policing, and surveillance.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes her stand out as a tech hero is that she does not just criticize problems from the outside. She uses research, public education, and policy engagement to push for change. Her message is that technology should serve people fairly, and that teams must measure performance across different groups so that systems do not silently fail on communities that already face barriers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buolamwini challenges norms in tech by showing that innovation without accountability is not progress. She demonstrates that ethical design requires asking who benefits, who is harmed, and who gets ignored when products are deployed at scale.
