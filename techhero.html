      <h3>Michael Running Wolf</h3>

      <p>
        Michael Running Wolf is an Indigenous technologist and researcher who pushes back against “one-size-fits-all” AI by
        centering Indigenous communities, data ownership, and language preservation. His work highlights a basic truth in this
        class: technology is never neutral—what we build reflects whose knowledge is valued, whose voices are included, and who
        gets to control the tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        One reason he stands out is that he focuses on language technology for Indigenous languages—areas that big tech often
        ignores because they are not “profitable enough” or don’t have massive datasets. Instead of treating communities as data
        sources, his approach emphasizes consent, collaboration, and protecting cultural knowledge. That flips the usual power
        dynamic where institutions extract data and communities receive little benefit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running Wolf is also known for leadership and public education: he’s spoken about ethics, representation, and what it
        means to build technology responsibly while respecting Indigenous sovereignty. In a space where marginalized people are
        often asked to “fit” existing systems, his work challenges the systems themselves—especially around who AI is for and who
        gets harmed when bias is baked into tools.
