<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to my website for LIS 500: Code and Power. This site shares course materials,
    reflections, and resources exploring how technology and information systems are shaped by
    power, bias, and social inequality.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout this course, I examine how assumptions about race, gender, class, and access
    become embedded in technology and what that means for fairness, responsibility, and equity
    in the digital world.
</p>

<p>
    This website includes an About Me page, a resource guide on implicit bias and
    intersectionality, and a Tech Hero profile highlighting someone working to improve equity
    in technology.
