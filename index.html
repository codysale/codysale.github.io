    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
        Welcome to my website for LIS 500: Code and Power. This site will be used to share course
        materials, reflections, and resources as we explore how technology and information systems
        are shaped by power, bias, and social structures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the course, I examine how assumptions about race, gender, class, and access
        become embedded in technology and what that means for equity and responsibility in the
        digital world.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website includes an About Me page, resources for understanding implicit bias and
        intersectionality, and a Tech Hero profile highlighting someone working to improve equity
        in the technology space.
